Project Assignment (Teams of 4) —

Distributed Real-Time Drawing Board with

Mini-RAFT Consensus



1\. Introduction

Modern cloud-native applications rely heavily on distributed consensus, fault tolerance,

zero-downtime deployments, and state replication. Leading systems such as

● Amazon Web Services (AWS)

● Google Cloud

● Microsoft Azure

use consensus-backed metadata stores (e.g., etcd, Consul) to guarantee correct

behavior under failures.



This assignment immerses you in real-world cloud engineering by building a distributed,

real-time collaboration platform using WebSockets, Docker, bind-mounted hot reload, and a

mini-RAFT-like consensus protocol.

Over 3 weeks, your team of four will design, implement, deploy, and test a fault-tolerant

multi-replica system that supports:

● Leader election

● Log replication

● Zero-downtime rolling replacement

● Consistent state under failure

● Real-time propagation of drawing events



Your final product should mimic the reliability and behavior of real distributed systems used in

production.



2\. Problem Statement

You will build a Distributed Real-Time Drawing Board, similar to a collaborative whiteboard.

Users draw on a browser canvas, and the drawing strokes must appear instantly for all

connected clients.

The backend system is not a simple server, but a cluster of three replicas that maintain a

shared “stroke log” through a RAFT-like consensus protocol. A fourth service — the Gateway

— manages WebSocket clients.

The challenge:

Even if any replica is restarted, hot-reloaded, or replaced, the system must maintain

availability and preserve consistent state with zero downtime.



3\. System Architecture

3.1 Required Components

A. Gateway Service (WebSocket Server)

● Accepts browser connections

● Forwards incoming strokes to the current leader replica

● Broadcasts committed strokes to all clients

● Must automatically re-route traffic to a new leader during failover



B. Replica Nodes (3 Containers)

Each replica must implement:

1\. Follower Mode

2\. Candidate Mode



3\. Leader Mode



Core responsibilities:

● Maintain append-only stroke log

● Participate in leader election

● Replicate logs

● Commit strokes when majority replicas confirm

● Expose RPC endpoints:

○ /request-vote

○ /append-entries

○ /heartbeat

○ /sync-log — called by a rejoining node to request all

committed log entries from index N onward; the leader

responds with the full list of missing entries



C. Shared Bind-Mounted Hot-Reload Files

Each replica must mount its implementation folder:

replica1/

replica2/

replica3/

Editing any file must cause:

● Auto container reload

● Graceful shutdown of old replica

● New instance joins cluster

● RAFT-lite election occurs without disconnecting clients



4\. Mini-RAFT Specification

A simplified RAFT protocol will be implemented as follows:

4.1 Node States

● Follower — waits for leader heartbeats

● Candidate — initiates elections

● Leader — handles replication and commits



4.2 Election Rules

● Election timeout: random 500–800 ms

● If follower misses heartbeat → becomes candidate

● Candidate increments term and requests votes

● Node becomes leader on receiving majority (≥2) votes



Heartbeat Interval: 150 ms



4.3 Log Replication Rules

When clients send a stroke:

Client → Gateway → Leader

Leader actions:

1\. Append stroke to local log

2\. Send AppendEntries(term, leaderId, entry) to followers

3\. Followers append to their logs and respond



4\. When majority acknowledges, leader marks entry as committed

5\. Leader broadcasts stroke to Gateway → all clients



Safety Rules

● Committed entries must never be overwritten

● Higher term always wins

● Split votes must retry election

● A restarted node must catch up via leader → follower sync

Catch-Up Protocol (Restarted Nodes)

1\. Restarted node starts in Follower state with an empty log

2\. On first AppendEntries from the leader, prevLogIndex check fails → follower responds

with its current log length

3\. Leader calls /sync-log on the follower, sending all committed entries from that index

onward

4\. Follower appends all missing entries and updates its commit index

5\. Follower is now in sync and participates normally



5\. Cloud Computing Concepts Embedded in This

Assignment → VIVA TOPICS

This project directly teaches essential cloud infrastructure theory, including:

5.1 Consensus \& Fault Tolerance

Used in:

● Key-value stores (etcd, Consul)



● Database clusters (CockroachDB)

● Container orchestration tools (Kubernetes)



You will experience:

● Leader failover

● Term-based elections

● Majority quorum requirements



5.2 Zero-Downtime Deployments (Blue-Green / Rolling

Upgrades)

When replicas auto-reload, your system must continue serving users without interruption.

5.3 State Replication \& Event Ordering

Critical for:

● Log-based storage

● Distributed streaming systems

● Real-time collaborative applications



5.4 Containerization \& Service Isolation

Using Docker and docker-compose:

● Multi-container microservice architecture

● Bind mounts for hot-reload

● Service discovery



5.5 Real-Time Systems



WebSocket communication ensures low-latency collaboration, as used in tools like Figma and

Miro.



6\. Technical Requirements

6.1 Functional Requirements

Frontend

● Browser canvas

● Draw lines using mouse/touch

● Real-time rendering of own + remote strokes

● No flickering or lag during failovers



Gateway

● Manage WebSocket connections

● Re-route strokes to active leader

● Gracefully handle leader changes

● Avoid disconnecting clients



Replicas (Core Logic)

Must support:

● Leader election

● Term maintenance

● AppendEntries RPC



● RequestVote RPC

● Heartbeat RPC

● Log commit logic

● Catch-up synchronization for restarted nodes

● Zero-downtime container reload behavior

● Dropping outdated leaders



6.2 Non-Functional Requirements

● Consistency: All clients must see identical canvas state

● Availability: System must always respond

● Fault Tolerance: Replicas can be stopped/reloaded anytime

● Scalability: Adding replicas should not break correctness

● Observability: Replicas must log elections, terms, and commits



7\. Docker \& Deployment Requirements

7.1 Mandatory Docker Features

● Each replica must be a separate container

● Bind-mounted source folder must cause nodemon/air auto-reload

● Restarting a replica triggers RAFT vote

● System must maintain zero downtime

This assignment simulates real components found in distributed cloud systems:

✔ Microservice Architecture:

Replica scaling, fault tolerance, service communication

✔ Production Deployments:

Blue-green \& rolling updates mimicked via hot-reload container swaps

✔ Real-Time Collaboration Apps:



Figma, Miro, Google Docs rely on similar event-sourcing \& consistency models

✔ Cloud Infrastructure Engineering:

Understanding RAFT concepts is essential for backend, SRE, DevOps, and distributed systems

roles.
